# notebooks
These notebooks were developed by the NOAO Data Lab group to demonstrate aspects of data access and exploration for the SMASH DR1 release.  The notebooks available are:

# SMASH_Basic_Access.ipynb 
   Shows how to obtain and visualize the SMASH DR1 field list, query and plot average photometry of a single field, and query and plot the light curve of a single source.

# SMASH_Star_Galaxy_cuts.ipynb
  Demonstrates how to apply cuts to the SMASH DR1 average photometry catalog to create samples of stars and galaxies.  Uses Datashader for interactive visualization of millions of points.

# SMASH_HydraII_interactive.ipynb
   Demonstrates the discovery of the Hydra II dwarf galaxy in the SMASH DR1 data.  Involves querying the database, filtering the result, and making an interacte plot of the spatial distribution and color-magnitude diagram.

# SMASH_map.ipynb
  Demonstrates using Bokeh and Datashader to interactively explore all-sky data from the SMASH DR1 catalog.

# SMASH_dropouts.ipynb
  Creates a query to find ugr-dropout objects, and demonstrates the use of the Data Lab Simple Image Access service to obtain image cutouts for a single object.
